About the Game
**Catch the Cheese** is a small browser game inspired by my pet **jackdaw**, who loved eating cheese.  
It’s my **first ever web game** and one of my earliest projects using **JavaScript** to make something interactive.

The goal:
Move your bird left and right to catch the spawned cheese pieces the timer counts how long it took you to catch them!  
Each cheese you catch gives you a point.

It all started with a jackdaw, a slice of cheese, and a simple idea in 2023.
